The VarFlow class is an implementation of Bruhn et al's variational optical flow algorithm. An example of how to use the class can be found in example.cpp. Make sure your compiler environment is set up to link with the OpenCV libraries correctly. The VarFlow class was developed with OpenCV 1.1, but it should work with 2.0 as well.
